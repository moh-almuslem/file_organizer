The script is supposed to read a list of all files in a targeted directory and moves files with same the same format to a seprate desired directory. 
How it works:
main directory has files with the following extensions:
.pdf
.txt
.xlsx or .csv
.pptx
.docx

After running the script, files will be moved to new seperate directories organized by file format.

Future goal:

-add more formats.
-add the option to move files with similar name or project, not just by file extension.
